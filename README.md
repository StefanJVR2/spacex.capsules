# Space X Capsule API
This API acts as a proxy for https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/capsules/, it makes of an in-memory database to speed up results.
There are two ways to add a capsule to the in-memory store, either by performing a GET on `/capsules/{capsule_serial}` or a POST, the main 
difference being that the GET will store and return the data, while the POST will only store the data.
